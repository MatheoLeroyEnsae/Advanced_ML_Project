As with many monastic cheeses, this variety is matured in humid cave-like conditions. The rind is washed in perry because the 100 or so varieties of perry pear known nationally are peculiar to this part of Gloucestershire and its border areas.  One of these varieties is ‘Stinking Bishop’, a name which seems appropriate for this cheese.  The Stinking Bishop pear was in turn named after a local mid 19th Century farmer called Frederick Bishop.

[PAR] Ann Landers and Abigail (Dear Abby) Van Buren, arguably the most famous advice columnists, should have asked for some advice on their own relationship. Their lives began as most twins’ do, which is to say, similar. The identical twins, born Esther “Eppie” and Pauline Friedman, respectively, were born in Iowa in 1918 and attended nearby Morningside College, where they both worked on the school’s newspaper. They married their husbands in a\\xa0double marriage ceremony on their 21st birthday in July 1939. In 1956, their similarities turned into contention. Mere months after Eppie assumed the position of the Chicago Sun Times’ “Ann Landers” advice columnist following the creator’s death, Pauline began her own similar column, “Dear Abby.”',\n",

       "  'context': '[PAR] Facebook [PAR] Pinterest [PAR] In Search of the South Land, Tasmanian History [PAR] In 1633, at the age of 30, Abel Tasman signed up with the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC), from where he was sent to the East on a three-year contract as a merchant. It wasn’t long before he commanded several of the company’s ships, making several trips to the East Indies. Returning to the Netherlands in 1637, Tasman left again the following year for Batavia (now Djakarta, Indonesia). This time he was in command of the ship ‘Engel’, on a 10-year contract, with his wife to accompany him. Batavia was a very rich city, and the East India Company held a powerful position. [PAR] \\xa0 [PAR] Tasman undertook several more trips, sailing to Formosa, Japan, Cambodia and Palembang as merchant captain, after which he began making exploratory voyages to China, Cambodia, Japan, and Sumatra. This brought him to the attention of Antonio van Diemen, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, who then gave Tasman a commission to explore the southern oceans. [PAR] European Explorers and the Southern Continent [PAR] On 13 August 1642 he was instructed to find what was believed to be a ‘very rich but mysterious’ Southern Continent, one which had eluded many European explorers for centuries. Known as ‘Terra australis incognita’, it was said to stretch across the Pacific. ',\n",

Man is known to develop a fear of anything and everything and Zoophobia is one of the most common specific phobias. Research conducted on this phobia has shown that humans have a genetic predisposition to fear certain types of animals. Often animals like snakes, spiders, insects etc stimulate a disgust/fear response in us. To an extent, this fear is necessary for the survival of human species. The degree or extent to which humans fear certain animals is directly correlated to the animal’s characteristics, fear-evoking properties and their discrepancy from human form. [PAR] Surveys conducted on the fear of animals phobia have shown interesting results. These studies mainly required dividing the animals in 2 categories namely: ‘fear relevant’ and ‘fear irrelevant’ animals. Simply explained; some animals can be considered cute or harmless, others as ferocious or wild and a third category as ‘slimy or disgusting’. In majority of the countries where the survey was conducted, it was observed that the ‘disgust relevant animals’ category had a greater fear score as compared to animals in the other two categories.

       "  'context': \"[PAR] Reasons: [PAR] The main reason for the launch of the war was the Spartan fear of Athens's growing power and prosperity. Athens rule over most of the Mediterranean region along with Greece/Hellas, 50 years preceding the war, instigated the war. [PAR] According to Thucydides, that after Athens became the leader of the Delian League, they became the supreme power known as the Athenian Empire. They nearly drove out the Persians from their regions of Aegean and occupied supremacy over a large number of territories. Athens naval power was also growing day-by-day endangering the bordering states. [PAR] During the Persian war in 480 BC, Athens power had grown by leaps and bounds and with the help of its allies continued its attacks on the Persian territories of Ionia and Aegean. Athens also constructed walls around its empire to save them from Spartan land attack, when the Persians fled Greece. This enraged the Spartans, who took no action at that time. [PAR] In 459 BC Athens took advantage between the Megara and Corinth war siding with Megara. This helped them gain a foothold on the Isthmus of Corinth. This resulted in a war, known as the 'The First Peloponnesian War' fought between Athens and Sparta, Corinth, Aegean and other states. At the end of the war, however, Athens backed out from Greek mainland, due to an enormous attack by the Spartans. A thirty years treaty was signed between Athens and Sparta in 446 BC. \",\n",

The store is of very impressive dimensions and there are more than 330 different departments within that cover more than one million square feet of floor. Several of the departments within the store are world famous. [PAR] History of the Store [PAR] Harrods was founded by Charles Henry Harrod back in 1824 when he was just 25 years old. The original location was in Southwalk, where the business was a haberdashery, drapery and merchant. He ran the business here until 1831, and in 1832 he opened the first Harrods grocer in Clerkenwell. Then in 1834 he opened a grocer in the east end of London where he specialized in wholesale and particularly in tea. Then in 1849 Harrod took over a shop in Brompton, on the site where the store stands today. The business started off with two employees, but by 1880 he was already employing an astounding one hundred people. [PAR] Fire of 1883 [PAR] In 1883 tragedy struck and the store burned to the ground. However, even after this reversal of fortune, Harrod remained committed to his customers and made all the Christmas deliveries he had on order that year. He also rebuilt the business, making a new building on the same site. ',\n",

       "  'context': 'the Rabbit-Proof Fence , is by Peter Gabriel . British producer Jeremy Thomas , who has a long connection with Australia, was executive producer of the film, selling it internationally through his sales arm, HanWay Films . [PAR] Contents [PAR] 8 External links [PAR] Plot [PAR] In Western Australia in 1931, in the remote town of Jigalong , three children live with their mother and grandmother. They are two sisters, 14-year-old Molly, 8-year-old Daisy, and their 10-year-old cousin Gracie. The town lies along the northern part of Australia\\'s rabbit-proof fence, which runs for several thousand miles. [PAR] Thousands of miles away, the \"protector\" of Western Australian Aborigines, A. O. Neville , signs an order to relocate the three girls to his re-education camp. The children are referred to by Neville as \" half-castes \", because they have one white and one Aboriginal parent. Neville\\'s reasoning is portrayed as: the Aboriginal peoples of Australia are a danger to themselves, and the \"half-castes\" must be bred out of existence. He plans to place the girls in a camp where they, along with all half-castes of that age range, will grow up. They will then presumably become labourers and servants to white families, regarded as a \"good\" situation for them in life. Eventually if they marry, it will be to white people and thus the Aboriginal \"blood\" will diminish. ',\n",

Its brevity, smooth tone, and straightforward use of natural imagery present his abstract ideas about philosophy and poetry in a compact way. Think of it as Shelley’s own summary of himself – or at least one aspect of himself. [PAR] \\xa0 [PAR] Why Should I Care? [PAR] Shmoop cannot tell a lie: caring about Percy Bysshe Shelley can be hard. He’s probably the most difficult of the Romantic poets to fall in love with. Luckily, he’s not the most difficult poet. He’s hard to love, but not too hard to understand. [PAR] What are we talking about? Well, you may have heard from someone, like an English teacher, that good poetry has certain characteristics: it’s concrete instead of abstract; it’s detailed instead of general; it’s visceral instead of spiritual. Basically, what we think of as a \"good poem\" these days just isn’t one of the abstract flights of fancy that you tend to get from the neo-Platonic, head-in-the-clouds Percy Bysshe Shelley. [PAR] It’s not that Shelley doesn’t use detailed imagery or powerful language, because he does. If you wrote, \"I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!\" in a poem today, though, and sent it off to a prestigious magazine ',\n",

       "  'context': '  The competition which included wines from all over Europe and France, was won by a sweet wine from Cyprus widely believed to be Commandaria.  The Commandery region itself fell into the control of his descendant Philip IV in 1307, after the suppression of the Knights Templar. [PAR] Another legend has it that the Ottoman sultan Selim II invaded the island just to acquire Commandaria; also that the grapes used to make this wine were the same grapes exported to Portugal that eventually became famous as the source of port wine.  [PAR] Production  [PAR] Commandaria is made exclusively from two types of indigenous Cyprus grapes: Xynisteri and Mavro.  The grapes are left to overripe on the vine and when sugar content reaches acceptable levels (corresponding to high must weight) they are harvested. More specifically, Xynisteri is picked when at around 12 degrees Baumé (°Bé) and Mavro at 15-16 °Bé. The grapes are then laid out in the sun to further increase the sugar density through evaporation. When the must weight reaches 19 to 23 °Bé the juice is extracted thorough crushing and pressing.  Fermentation takes place in reservoirs and will arrest naturally due to the high levels of alcohol achieved at around 15%. The above process has to take place within the confines of 14 designated villages ',\n",

       "  'context': '[DOC] [TLE] Hestia - Religion-wiki - WikiaHestia | Religion-wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia [PAR] [ show ] [PAR] As an Olympian [PAR] Hestia is one of the three great goddesses of the first Olympian generation, along with Demeter and Hera . She was described as both the oldest and youngest of the three daughters of Rhea and Cronus , the sisters to three brothers Zeus , Poseidon , and Hades , in that she was the first to be swallowed by Cronus and the last to be disgorged. Originally listed as one of the Twelve Olympians , Hestia gave up her seat in favor of newcomer Dionysus to tend to the sacred fire on Mount Olympus . However, there is no ancient source for this claim. As Karl Kerenyi observes, [4] \"there is no story of Hestia\\'s ever having taken a husband or ever having been removed from her fixed abode.\" Every family hearth was her altar. Of the Olympian gods, Hestia has the fewest exploits \"since the hearth is immovable, Hestia is unable to take part even in the procession of the gods, let alone the other antics of the Olympians,\" Burkert remarks.

''There's a level of frustration when you are getting drilled by the same team for the second night in a row.'' [PAR] After trailing by as many as 43 in Indiana, the Pistons started the second game of the home-and-home series by missing 16 of their first 17 shots. [PAR] ''Our starting unit defends as well as any I have ever been around,'' Vogel said. ''They've been doing this all year, and that's a big reason for our success.'' [PAR] Still, as good as Indiana's defense may be, the Pacers aren't usually holding teams to under 6 percent shooting for long stretches of the game. [PAR] ''We got a good example tonight of playoff basketball,'' Pistons coach Lawrence Frank said. ''We missed some shots at the rim early on, and then we got frustrated and started getting away from what we wanted to do.'' [PAR] The Pacers struggled to take advantage, turning the ball over seven times in the first nine minutes of the game. That's when Granger checked in for the first time this season. [PAR] ''It was different, because we were trying to get Danny into the loop - we all wanted him to get into a groove\",\n",

Their best-selling model is the Ibiza, with over 14,158 registrations in this country. AutoeBidâ€™s sales figures for SEAT will be updated after September 2016, when the 66 registration plate is launched. [PAR] Founded in 1950, SEAT is an acronym for 'Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de AutomÃ³viles de Turismo', or in English 'Spanish Passenger Car Company'. Typical of Fiat Group in the pre-General Motors period, it sought out car-making niche companies around the world to widen its activity sphere. SEAT and Fiat established a factory in Barcelona with a large slice of the business given to the Franco government. The union produced a range of cars that were all Fiat-related. In 1986, Volkswagen became the majority shareholder of SEAT, completely taking over SEAT in 1990. Ever since, SEAT has had its headquarters at Martorell on the outskirts of Barcelona. [PAR] Since Volkswagenâ€™s takeover in 1990, SEAT has been increasing its presence in the motorsport world. \",\n",

       "  'context': 'In her Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Stowe admitted that only a minority of slave owners could be as thoroughly evil and degenerate as Simon Legree. [PAR] The point, however, is that men like Simon Legree could and did exist, and they were largely immune from punishment under American laws. Legree can torture and murder his slaves. He can refuse to let them practice their religion. He can keep them half-starved. He can buy fifteen-year-old Emmeline and use her as a sex slave if he wants. (Stowe doesn’t let him, but as readers we can see how easily it could happen, and how it did happen to Cassy.) [PAR] Stowe wants her reader to feel alarmed at even the possibility that someone like Legree could rule men, women, and children with impunity. She shows how the institution of slavery itself could cause even the best of men, like Mr. Shelby and Augustine St. Clare, to slip into sin. And when you have men whose moral nature is coarse, unrefined, and unresponsive to conscience, who are kept unchecked by the law, the cruelty they can perpetuate is terrifying to contemplate. Think of it this way: Stowe’s 19th century reader may be asking, \"Well, how bad could slavery ',\n",

[PAR] Part of Speech: Noun [PAR] Meaning: The name of an extremist Shiite Muslim military organization supported by Syria and Iran operating in southern Lebanon. Its current leader is Hassan Nasrallah. [PAR] Notes: Today\\'s word has been spelled Hizbollah and Hizbullah in English but our spelling seems to have settled in as the standard.  A member of Hezbollah is a Hezbollahi.  Now you can be the first in your neighborhood to know the plural of this word: it is Hezbollahin. [PAR] In Play: Hezbollah forces have been a threat to Israel for many years. They have been responsible for many attacks against Israel and a war that resulted in much loss of life and great destruction in both countries. During that war, rocket attacks on the Israeli cities of Haifa, Tiberias, Acre, Shlomi, and Carmiel sent the residents of these cities into bomb shelters or completely out of those towns. [PAR] Word History: [PAR] Since Hezbollah was inspired by the successful Iranian revolution, it is no surprise that its name comes from Persian (Farsi) hezbollah \"Party of God\".  The Persian word is based on Arabic hizbullah, made up of hizb \"party\" + Allah \"God\".  The term was probably first used at a meeting in the Iraqi city of Najef in 1969, where the idea of a Muslim revolution in Lebanon was first advanced. ',\n",

Aragon stretches south almost half the length of Spain, and although it’s a landlocked area, it holds a wealth of topographical contrasts. [PAR] The Pyrenees dominate the landscape in the north. The highest peaks of the mountain range that separates France and Spain can be found in Aragon, making it an ideal location for skiing in winter. Then there is the lush Ebro Valley, dotted with pretty villages, and the vibrant city of Zaragoza (known as Saragossa by many in the English-speaking world). Zaragoza is Aragon’s capital and the most densely populated city of the region. [PAR] The treeless plateaus of central Aragon contrast vividly with the mountain regions and the fertile Ebro Valley. Here you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in the whole of Spain. Everywhere there are castles, although many of them are now, sadly, in ruins. '}}"
